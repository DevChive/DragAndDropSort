# DragAndDropSort
Sortable Drag and Drop Sample

Drag’n’Drop is just another way the user can interact with the data in a mobile application (quite a powerful one I might add). It can be used to move items in a list from one category to another or simply to adjust the priority of list items. In this context, ListView ordering with drag and drop can be treated as a user input and in the world of MVVM and Xamarin.Forms these changes should be reflected on the ViewModel.

In this sample, we have a drag and drop reordering functionality for iOS and Android platforms on Xamarin.Forms.
